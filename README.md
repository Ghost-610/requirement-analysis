Requirement Analysis in Software Development

### What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is the systematic process of identifying, documenting, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It involves gathering, analyzing, and defining what the software should do, how it should behave, and what constraints it must operate within. Requirement analysis is not just a phase in the SDLC - it's the cornerstone that determines the success or failure of a software project. Investing time and resources in thorough requirement analysis pays dividends throughout the entire development lifecycle by reducing risks, improving quality, and ensuring stakeholder satisfaction.

### Importance in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

1. User interface design is based on user requirements
2. Developers use requirements to understand what to build
3. Requirements form the basis for test case creation
4. Scope Creep: Well-defined requirements prevent uncontrolled expansion
5. Miscommunication: Clear documentation reduces misunderstandings
